Slides 2 Go

Slides 2 Go is a web application that makes it very easy to create and show slides. The slides are stored in a single text file using an extended Markdown syntax. The text file is stored as a Gist on Github. Slides 2 Go takes this gist and creates a presentation that needs only a web browser to be displayed.
