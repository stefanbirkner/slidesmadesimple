Slides made Simple
==================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stefanbirkner/slidesmadesimple.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanbirkner/slidesmadesimple)

Slides made Simple is a web application that makes it very easy to create and show slides. The slides are stored in a single text file using an extended Markdown syntax. The text file is stored as a Gist on Github. Slides made Simple takes this gist and creates a presentation that needs only a web browser to be displayed.

The application runs on Heroku: http://slidesmadesimple.herokuapp.com/
